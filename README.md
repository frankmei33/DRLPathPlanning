# DRLPathPlanning

This repository provides code for paper Observability-based Energy Efficient Path Planning with Background Flow via Deep Reinforcement Learning, IEEE Conference on Decision and Control 2023 (accepted for publication). It includes an example on Double-Gyre Flow using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and PPO-LSTM, as well as code for a baseline comparison of model predictive control (MPC) on a greedy path. 

The implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is based on [PPO-Pytorch](https://github.com/nikhilbarhate99/PPO-PyTorch).
